Okay! Here’s the detailed and explicit explanation of why “This delete user functionality can be done after authentication” is a bad idea:

Detailed Analysis: Is “Delete User Functionality After Authentication” a Good Idea?

Answer: No, it’s not. Here’s why:

1. Authentication vs Authorization

Authentication and Authorization are two different things in security:

Authentication: This is the process of verifying a user’s identity. When a user logs in, they provide credentials (username and password) that are checked to confirm who they are. Authentication ensures the person accessing the system is who they say they are.

Authorization: This determines what an authenticated user can do within the system. Authorization policies define what actions a user can perform based on their roles or permissions. Even if a user is authenticated, they may not be authorized to perform certain actions.

2. Authentication Alone is Not Enough

Why authentication alone is not enough:

Authentication confirms a user is who they say they are but doesn’t control their level of access or permissions within the system. Once authenticated, a user may have access to many functionalities but can’t delete other users’ profiles because of their permissions.

Security Risks: If the delete functionality is available to all authenticated users without any additional checks, any logged in user can delete profiles and that’s a security risk or misuse. For example, an authenticated user without proper authorization can delete another user’s profile maliciously or accidentally.

3. Why Authorization Matters

Authorization ensures that:

Permissions are Enforced: Authorization checks if the authenticated user has the right permissions to delete. This might include role-based access control (RBAC) or other permission checks that prevents unauthorized users from performing sensitive operations.

Security is Preserved: By having authorization, you ensure only users with specific roles or permissions can delete profiles. This prevents unauthorized deletions and keeps user management intact.

4. Example

Scenario:

Users can log in (authentication) but there’s no authorization check for deleting profiles.

Case 1: An authenticated user who shouldn’t have admin privileges can delete other users’ profiles. This can be accidental or intentional removal of important profiles.

Case 2: If only admin users are allowed to delete profiles, then an authentication-only approach would not prevent a non-admin user from doing this as the system wouldn’t check their authorization level.

Conclusion

The requirement to delete profile after authentication is not enough because it doesn’t consider authorization.

Authentication confirms the user is who they say they are but doesn’t control what they can do.

Authorization is crucial to ensure only users with proper permissions can perform sensitive actions like deleting user profiles.

Both authentication and authorization. Authentication is identity, authorization is permissions. Prevents unauthorized.
